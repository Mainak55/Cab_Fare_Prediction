# Cab_Fare_Prediction
A cab rental start-up company had successfully run the pilot project and now want to launch their cab service across the country.
Historical data has been collected from the pilot project and now they want to apply analytics for fare prediction.
Our task is to apply different regression models on the data and provide them with a system that could predict the fare accurately.
